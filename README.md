## 👋 Hello! I’m Shraddha Pandey — I turn messy data into sharp decisions.

I’ve spent the last few years solving real-world problems across finance, healthcare, and AI research—not by throwing fancy models at them, but by building systems that work, explain themselves, and create actual impact.

At Cognizant, I helped financial teams screen 45,000+ loan applications using credit risk models I developed from the ground up—models that cut manual effort and improved recall on high-risk cases. At Recoup Health, I worked with clinicians to classify patient recovery outcomes based on wearable and survey data. Our model hit 96% balanced accuracy and directly supported treatment plans for 1,500+ remote patients. And at ASU, I built deep learning pipelines on regulatory filings (8,000+ S-1s) to predict IPO success—with interpretability baked in using SEC-BERT and SHAP.

## 🧠 Why I do this

Because data *should* mean something.

I care about fairness. About transparency. About building things that aren't just technically good, but actually usable by real people. That’s why I design models that are interpretable, pipelines that scale, and dashboards that make sense at a glance. Whether it’s a business team, a clinician, or a researcher—I want to hand them insights they can trust.
